# Emoji-Prediction-Sentiment-Analysis-

This is a simple task of building an LSTM model that takes in input a sentence and predicts the most appropriate emoji for that sentence. For this task we use the pretrained Glove vector embeddings that are 50 dimensional. 

## Dataset Used
We have a tiny dataset (X, Y) where:
- X contains 127 sentences (strings).
- Y contains an integer label between 0 and 4 corresponding to an emoji for each sentence.
